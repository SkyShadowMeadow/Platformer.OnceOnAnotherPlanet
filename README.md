# Once on another planet
____
## Description
This is a platformer where not only I demonstrate my knowledge and experience with Unity, but where I also try to make my ideas real. 
The main line is a new life on the planet where after the global catastrophe everything has been changed. The main character has to find a way to adapt to a new reality and maybe to find other survivors.

## Art
As I decided that I would like to try every step in the development of the game(except for the music), all artwork is done by me. The style chosen for the game is fairly simple but unique. I want it to be as less real as possible but still understandable from the human point.

My work with art includes animations of all interactions in the game.
